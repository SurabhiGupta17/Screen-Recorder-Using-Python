# Screen Recorder using Python
This is a simple screen recording script that allows you to record your computer screen using Python. It captures screenshots of your desktop and saves them to a video file using OpenCV.


## Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
PyAutoGUI (pip install pyautogui)
## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the screen_recorder.py file.

2. Install the required libraries by running pip install opencv-python pyautogui.

3. Run the script using python screen_recorder.py.

4. Enter the filename and path where you want to save the recording (e.g. C:/Users/username/Desktop/recording.mp4).

5. Press q to stop the recording and save the video file.


The default frame rate is set to 25 FPS, but you can change it to your desired value by modifying the fps variable in the script.
